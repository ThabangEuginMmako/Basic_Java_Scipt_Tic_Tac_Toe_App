# Basic_Java_Scipt_Tic_Tac_Toe_App
Basic Tic_Tac_Toe App using HTML, CSS and Javasc

This setup creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game with basic functionality. Players can take turns clicking on cells to place their symbol (X or O), and the game displays a message indicating whose turn it is or if there's a winner or tie. The game logic is separated into a Game module, and the DOM manipulation is handled by a displayController module.
